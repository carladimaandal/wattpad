  Wattpad is a social reading platform that allows users to read and publish their own tales online. The platform, which was founded by Allen Lau and Ivan Yuen, intends to build social groups around stories and break down barriers between readers and writers. People can compose and publish stories on the platform, or simply read stories created by other users. I've been a wattpad reader for almost 5 years. As I explore Wattpad, I've come across some deserving authors who I'd want to promote to you. All of their experiences are relatable and worthwhile to read. Some of the authors have millions of followers, while others have only a few hundred. Nonetheless, this does not define the values of their stories.

<h1> Paper Planes </h1> 
<font size="7" color ="crimson" phase="Source Sans Pro"> "I might wanna fly like a paper plane but in the end, I'd still choose falling for you."
    Leona Harriet Abelló and Ejercito Sandejas story. The epitome of a perfect daughter, Leona
    Harriet Abelló has always aimed to be the best in whatever she does to please her parents.
    She's not just a beauty queen-she's also a student model, part of the cream of the crop of her
    university, and of students aiming to graduate with flying colors.
    Though greatly admired by everyone, it is not a secret that she's friends with the university's
    black sheep-Ejercito Carlton Sandejas, her total opposite. Everyone is telling her to stop being
    friends with him, but there's this explicable pull between the two of them that Lena just can't cut
    Jer off from her life.
    As their relationship progresses from pure friendship into something more, she has found
    herself doing the exact things she shouldn't do: breaking the rules, playing with fate, and like a
    paper plane flying freely with the wind, she just found herself falling. Hard."
